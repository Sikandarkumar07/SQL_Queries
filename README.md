# SQL_Queries 

# 📚 SQL Project: Online Bookstore

   # 📖 Project Overview

     This project is a hands-on SQL practice based on an Online Bookstore scenario. It uses three CSV files (Books, Customers, Orders) to simulate a mini relational database and provides both basic and advanced        SQL queries for data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and analytics.
     The goal is to help learners understand how to work with realistic datasets and perform useful queries for business insights like sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management.

# 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

     ✅ Real-world scenario – similar to an e-commerce/bookstore database
     ✅ Structured datasets – easy to import & query
     ✅ Covers both basic & advanced SQL – from simple selects to aggregations & joins
     ✅ Business-driven queries – focuses on practical insights like revenue, stock, top customers, etc.
     ✅ Beginner-friendly yet scalable – can be extended with more data & queries

# 🔑 Project Highlights

   # ✅ Datasets

        Books.csv → Book details (Book_ID, Title, Genre, Price, Stock, Author)

        Customers.csv → Customer details (Customer_ID, Name, Email , Phone, Country, City)

        Orders.csv → Order details (Order_ID, Book_ID, Customer_ID, Quantity, Order_Date, Total_Amount)


  # ✅ Basic Queries
       •	Retrieve books in a specific genre (e.g., Fiction, Fantasy)
       •	Find books published after a certain year
       •	Show all customers from a specific country
       •	Display orders placed in a given month/year
       •	Find most/least expensive books, total stock, and lowest stock
       •	Calculate total revenue from all orders

 # ✅ Advanced Queries

      •	Total books sold per genre
      •	Average price of books in a specific genre
      •	Most frequently ordered book
      •	Top 3 most expensive books by genre
      •	Cities with customers spending over a set amount
      •	Customer who spent the most
      •	Remaining stock after fulfilling all orders


# ✅ SQL Concepts Covered

    ✔ Joins (INNER, LEFT)
    ✔ Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
    ✔ GROUP BY & HAVING
    ✔ Filtering, Sorting & Subqueries
